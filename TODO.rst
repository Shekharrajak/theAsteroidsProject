TODO:
 - [ ] Fix random spawn locations so that they are actually random.
 - [ ] Fix the game speed variable. Give it even a unit value. (screen widths per second)
 - [ ] Smaller asteroids should be faster.
 - [ ] Consolidate all of the small game variables into one place.
 - [ ] Display two asteroids when the asteroid is beside the edge so that it doesn't
       just 'jump' across.
 - [ ] Fix bullet to asteroid collision detection. ATM it's too small.
